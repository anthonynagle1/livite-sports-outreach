# Livite's Spring Signature Vegetable: A Complete Menu Development Brief

**The radish — prepared three ways — is Livite's strongest play for Spring 2026.** No competitor in the Brookline/Boston fast-casual market features radishes as a signature item. The watermelon radish in particular delivers an unmatched combination: the lowest ingredient cost on this list ($0.14–$0.38 per portion), three distinct prep methods from one vegetable (oven-roasted, raw-shaved, quick-pickled), hold times that exceed every other candidate, and an Instagram-ready hot-pink interior that photographs like nothing else on a plate. Asparagus and sugar snap peas round out a strong shortlist, but radishes give Livite something nobody else in Boston owns.

This report provides the full long list of 12 candidates, a detailed shortlist of 3 with complete menu concepts, and a dark horse recommendation — all designed to hand directly to the kitchen team for testing.

## Part 1: The long list — 12 spring vegetable candidates ranked

### 1. Radishes (watermelon + French breakfast varieties) ⭐ TOP PICK

**Best prep methods:** Oven-roasted halves at 400–425°F for 25–35 minutes (transforms peppery bite into sweet, potato-like mellowness); raw/shaved on mandoline (peppery crunch, stunning pink cross-section); quick-pickled in rice vinegar brine (ready in 30 minutes, holds 2+ weeks refrigerated). All three preps work in an oven-only kitchen.

**Why it says "spring":** Radishes are one of the first crops planted and harvested in New England spring gardens. Watermelon radishes are technically a fall/winter storage crop with peak availability October–April, transitioning to California-sourced through May. French breakfast radishes are available February–December, peaking in cool weather. Together, they bridge the full Feb–May window.

**Flavor profile and sauce pairings:** Raw radishes bring sharp peppery heat that softens dramatically when roasted into earthy sweetness. **Best pairings: Sumac-Lemon Yogurt** (tangy yogurt tempers raw radish bite, Middle Eastern harmony), **Green Goddess** (herbal tahini base complements both raw and roasted preps), **Lemon-Herb Tahini** (creamy pourable dressing that unifies the three textures). Also pairs beautifully with Chimichurri and Pistachio-Herb Crunch.

**New England sourcing:** **Siena Farms** (Sudbury, MA) lists watermelon radish as a top product, available through their wholesale program year-round via greenhouse and cold storage. Contact: Harvest Manager MJ Cordova (mj@sienafarms.com). **Red Fire Farm** (Granby, MA) explicitly stores watermelon and black radishes all winter for wholesale accounts; delivery to Boston on Fridays. **Baldor** (Chelsea, MA warehouse) carries watermelon radishes as product code RA9, available year-round. Standard radishes are always available through Sysco. French breakfast radishes sourced through Baldor or Sid Wainer & Son (New Bedford, MA).

**Estimated cost per portion:** **$0.14–$0.38 for standard radishes** (3–4 oz portion at $0.75–$1.50/lb wholesale). Watermelon radishes at $1.00–$1.50/lb through Baldor = **$0.19–$0.56/portion**. When thinly sliced for visual garnish, a single watermelon radish yields 8–15 salad portions at roughly **$0.10–$0.20 each**. This is the lowest-cost candidate on the entire list.

**Hold time after prep:** Roasted — 3–4 hours hot-hold, 3–5 days refrigerated cold. Raw shaved — 6–8 hours on cold line, refreshable in ice water. **Quick-pickled — 2+ weeks refrigerated, essentially unlimited on cold line.** This is the best hold-time profile of any candidate.

**Competitor uniqueness:** **Zero competitors feature radishes prominently.** Clover Food Lab uses radish in a minor supporting role (cucumber-radish salad in one bowl). Whole Heart Provisions used radish kimchi but is currently hibernating. Sweetgreen, CAVA, Life Alive — none feature radishes. Watermelon radish appears on only 1.5% of American restaurant menus, but that figure is up **160% in four years**, indicating rapid adoption in fine dining filtering down to fast-casual.

---

### 2. Asparagus ⭐

**Best prep:** Oven-roasted at 400–425°F for 12–15 minutes (charred tips, tender stems); raw-shaved into ribbons with mandoline or food processor shredding disc; panini press for quick grill marks on whole spears.

**Why it says "spring":** The single vegetable most universally associated with spring. Peak season March–May. Entire festivals built around asparagus season. Hotels and restaurants have historically anchored spring menus around asparagus as a centerpiece.

**Flavor and sauce pairings:** Grassy, vegetal sweetness when roasted; bright and slightly bitter when raw. **Best pairings: Lemon-Herb Toss** (classic combination), **Basil Pesto** (Italian spring tradition), **Chimichurri** (Sweetgreen's own spring strategy uses chimichurri dressing — pair it with the vegetable they don't feature).

**Sourcing:** Year-round from Peru/Mexico via Sysco and Baldor at **$2.90–$4.35/lb** (11 lb cartons $32–$48). Lowest prices during peak import season (March–May). Local New England asparagus available mid-May only (Hadley, MA is famous for its asparagus festival). Reliable broadline availability Feb–May.

**Cost per portion:** **$0.47–$1.13** (3–4 oz at $2.50–$4.50/lb). Mid-range cost.

**Hold time:** Roasted cold-hold is excellent for room-temp or chilled salad applications — 3–4 days refrigerated. Hot-hold degrades after 2–3 hours (turns army-green and soft). **Best strategy: roast in AM, serve at room temperature all day.**

**Competitor uniqueness:** Sweetgreen does not feature asparagus. CAVA does not. Life Alive does not. B.Good featured it seasonally but is now largely closed in Boston. **Wide open as a spring signature in Boston fast-casual.** However, asparagus is familiar enough that competitors could easily replicate the concept.

---

### 3. Sugar snap peas ⭐

**Best prep:** Raw bias-cut into ½-inch pieces (the default — zero cooking needed); oven-blistered at 425–450°F for 8–10 minutes (charred spots, slightly collapsed but intensely sweet); de-string and leave whole for dramatic visual.

**Why it says "spring":** Peak season April–June. Aligns with the 2026 "#CrunchTok" textural trend identified by AF&Co. + Carbonate. The "snap" — both audible and textural — is a sensory spring signal.

**Flavor and sauce pairings:** Sweet, grassy, bright, with satisfying crunch. **Best pairings: Lemon-Mint Vinaigrette** (bright + bright = peak freshness), **Green Goddess** (herbal tahini base matches snap peas' garden sweetness), **Pistachio-Herb Crunch** (crumble topper adds textural contrast to the snap).

**Sourcing:** Year-round from Guatemala/Peru at **$3.40–$4.50/lb** (10 lb cartons $34–$45). Local availability late May–June only. Reliable through Baldor and Sysco Feb–May. Prices may spike off-season ($5–6+/lb) but the Feb–May window aligns with import peak season.

**Cost per portion:** **$0.48–$1.03** (3–4 oz portion). Comparable to asparagus.

**Hold time:** **Raw is exceptional: 6–8 hours on cold line, 3–5 days prepped refrigerated.** Blanched holds 4–6 hours cold. Roasted/blistered loses texture after 2–3 hours. Raw snap peas are arguably the single best holding vegetable for fast-casual service.

**Competitor uniqueness:** **Nobody in Boston fast-casual features snap peas.** Not Sweetgreen, CAVA, Life Alive, Clover — zero. They're used primarily as a garnish element at fine dining, never as a signature component.

---

### 4. Fennel

**Best prep:** Oven-roasted wedges at 400°F for 25–35 minutes (caramelized, sweet, almost buttery); raw-shaved on mandoline (anise-flavored, crunchy, ethereal when translucent); fronds reserved for garnish and Vitamix into Green Goddess dressing.

**Why it says "spring":** Bridges late winter and early spring. Available year-round from California. The anise-sweet flavor profile reads as "fresh awakening" on a spring plate.

**Sourcing:** Year-round from California, **$28–$34 per 24-count carton** via Baldor or Sysco. **~$1.50–$2.50/lb** wholesale. Extremely reliable. Not a local NE crop.

**Cost per portion:** **$0.38–$0.75** after ~30% trim waste (stalks/outer layers). Mid-range.

**Hold time:** Roasted 3–4 hours hot, 3–4 days cold. Raw shaved 4–6 hours in citrus dressing (actually improves as it softens). Very good.

**Competitor uniqueness:** Zero presence in Boston fast-casual. Polarizing anise flavor limits universal appeal, but devotees are passionate. The architectural fronds are stunning on a plate.

---

### 5. Golden beets (Chioggia for raw accent)

**Best prep:** Oven-roasted whole at 425°F for 35–45 minutes (baby size), skins slip off. Chioggia sliced raw on mandoline for bullseye pattern (loses stripes when cooked — raw only for visual impact).

**Why it says "spring":** Year-round availability, but golden color reads as "sunshine" and "spring renewal." Chioggia's candy-cane cross-section is visually arresting.

**Sourcing:** Year-round from Canada, Michigan, Mexico. Baby beets **$2.50–$4.00/lb** for specialty varieties; standard red **$1.00–$2.00/lb**. Baldor and Sysco both carry. Golden beets at ~30–50% premium over red.

**Cost per portion:** **$0.47–$1.00** for specialty golden/Chioggia; $0.19–$0.50 for standard red.

**Hold time:** **Exceptional — 4+ hours cold-hold, 4–5 days refrigerated after roasting.** Beets are among the most stable roasted vegetables. Pickled beets hold 1–2 weeks.

**Competitor uniqueness:** Life Alive and Clover both use beets (primarily red, roasted). Sweetgreen features raw beets. **The golden/Chioggia angle differentiates, but beets themselves are not unique in the market.** Critical advantage of golden: **zero staining** (red beets stain everything and are operationally problematic in fast-casual).

---

### 6. Artichoke hearts (from frozen)

**Best prep:** Oven-roasted from frozen at 425°F for 20–25 minutes — thaw, pat dry thoroughly, toss with olive oil. Develops golden-brown exterior with crispy edges resembling Roman fried artichoke. Alternatively, marinate in lemon-herb vinaigrette overnight for cold applications.

**Why it says "spring":** Classic spring vegetable in Mediterranean tradition. Globe artichokes from California peak March–May.

**Sourcing:** Frozen hearts are the only viable option for fast-casual (fresh artichoke yields only 20–25% edible heart and is extremely labor-intensive). Frozen at **$3–$5/lb** via Sysco or Baldor. Canned (#10 cans) at **$0.83–$1.33/lb** drained — best value for marinated prep. Year-round, highly reliable.

**Cost per portion:** **$0.16–$0.33** from canned; **$0.56–$0.94** from frozen. Very affordable.

**Hold time:** Roasted 3–4 hours hot or cold. Marinated 5–7 days refrigerated (improves with time). Excellent.

**Competitor uniqueness:** Nobody in Boston fast-casual features artichoke hearts as a prepared vegetable component. Mediterranean identity pairs well with existing sauce lineup (Sumac-Lemon Yogurt, Romesco, Lemon-Herb Tahini). Slight perception risk: "artichoke hearts from frozen" doesn't carry the same farm-fresh story as whole vegetables.

---

### 7. English peas (from frozen)

**Best prep:** Thaw high-quality frozen peas — no cooking needed (already blanched before flash-freezing). Vitamix into bright green pea puree with mint and lemon for a signature sauce/swipe. Alternatively, oven-warm in pan at 350°F for 10–12 minutes.

**Why it says "spring":** The quintessential spring vegetable. "Spring peas" is as iconic as asparagus. Pea and mint is the definitive spring flavor pairing.

**Sourcing:** Fresh shelled peas have sporadic availability and are prohibitively labor-intensive (40% yield after shelling). **Frozen is the only viable option: $1.00–$2.00/lb wholesale.** Flash-frozen at peak sweetness, often superior to "fresh" peas in the supply chain. Year-round via Sysco.

**Cost per portion:** **$0.19–$0.50** — extremely affordable from frozen.

**Hold time:** Thawed whole peas 4–6 hours cold. Pea puree 2–3 days refrigerated with slight color loss. Good.

**Competitor uniqueness:** Nobody in Boston fast-casual features English peas or pea puree. The vivid green Vitamix puree would be visually distinctive. However, peas function better as a **supporting element or sauce** than as a standalone anchor vegetable.

---

### 8. Pea shoots / pea tendrils

**Best prep:** Raw only — too delicate for any heat application. Wash, pick through for yellowed pieces. Use as salad green, bowl topping, or garnish.

**Why it says "spring":** Delicate spring greens associated with farmers' markets and early season. The microgreens/sprouts market is valued at **$3.24B globally (2024), projected $7.97B by 2032**.

**Sourcing:** Specialty distributors (Baldor, Sid Wainer) and local indoor growers at **$8–$12/lb wholesale.** Asian grocery markets sometimes carry at $3–$5/lb. Year-round from indoor growing operations.

**Cost per portion:** **$0.75–$2.25** for 2–3 oz primary portion — expensive. As 1 oz garnish accent: **$0.38–$0.75.**

**Hold time:** **Poor — 3–5 hours on line maximum.** Wilts quickly at room temperature. Must stay cold. Refrigerated shelf life 5–7 days. Requires ordering twice weekly minimum.

**Competitor uniqueness:** Nobody features pea shoots prominently, but they're also not a signature anchor — better as a premium garnish that adds Instagram appeal to another star vegetable.

---

### 9. Hakurei / Tokyo turnips

**Best prep:** Oven-roasted at 400–425°F for 15–20 minutes (becomes sweet, almost marshmallow-like, buttery texture). No peeling needed — skin is tender and edible. Raw-shaved on mandoline (sweet, mild, fruity — nothing like regular turnips). Greens can be blanched separately as a zero-waste component.

**Why it says "spring":** Part of the 2026 "forgotten vegetables" trend explicitly cited by multiple industry forecasters. Root vegetables elevated through roasting is a key 2026 trend.

**Sourcing:** **Major challenge: not available through Sysco or standard broadline distributors.** Requires direct farm sourcing. Local availability starts **May only** in New England. Could potentially source from Baldor or Sid Wainer via California suppliers in April, but unreliable. **Does not meet the Feb–May reliability requirement through broadline channels.**

**Cost per portion:** **$0.28–$0.63** when available. Affordable but sourcing-dependent.

**Hold time:** Roasted 2–3 hours hot. Raw 6–8 hours cold. Good.

**Competitor uniqueness:** Nobody — truly zero presence in Boston fast-casual. The texture transformation from raw to roasted is remarkable and would generate word-of-mouth. However, sourcing constraints make this impractical as a Feb–May signature. **Better suited as a May-only LTO or the "dark horse" test item.**

---

### 10. Kohlrabi

**Best prep:** Raw-shaved into matchsticks or ribbons using food processor julienne disc (incredibly crunchy, mild, slightly sweet — described as an apple-broccoli hybrid). Oven-roasted cubes at 400–425°F for 25–30 minutes (tender, slightly sweet, less distinctive than raw prep). Purple variety more photogenic.

**Why it says "spring":** Available late spring through fall locally, but year-round from Texas via specialty distributors. Unusual enough to create curiosity and "spring discovery" narrative.

**Sourcing:** Limited at specialty distributors. Bunched cartons from Texas at **$26 per 24-count**. Not widely carried by Sysco — source through Baldor or Sid Wainer. Local farms grow it May–November.

**Cost per portion:** **$0.28–$0.63** after ~20–25% trim waste (peeling required).

**Hold time:** **Raw is exceptional — 6–8+ hours on cold line without quality loss.** One of the best-holding raw vegetables, period. Peeled whole: 5–7 days refrigerated.

**Competitor uniqueness:** Absolute zero presence in any Boston fast-casual restaurant. Most customers won't recognize it, which is both a challenge and an opportunity.

---

### 11. Fava beans

**Best prep:** From frozen only — thaw, blanch 2–3 minutes, ice bath, slip skins. Oven-roast at 400°F for crispy exterior (15–20 minutes). Vitamix into bright green fava puree/hummus with lemon, olive oil, garlic.

**Why it says "spring":** Classic Mediterranean spring vegetable. Rising trend in plant-forward menus.

**Sourcing:** Fresh in pod: prohibitively labor-intensive (60–90 minutes per 25 portions for double-shelling). Frozen shelled: **$3–$6/lb.** Fresh pods from Mexico at **$68–$70/bushel** with "offerings very light." Local availability late May at earliest.

**Cost per portion:** **$1.50–$3.75 from fresh (not viable); $0.56–$1.13 from frozen.**

**Hold time:** Blanched/peeled 2–3 days refrigerated. Puree 2–3 days. Acceptable but not exceptional.

**Competitor uniqueness:** Nobody features fava beans in Boston fast-casual. CAVA's Mediterranean platform seems natural for favas but hasn't pursued them. **Operational barrier is the deciding factor — even from frozen, individual skin-peeling is tedious.** Not recommended as a signature unless used exclusively as a puree.

---

### 12. Green garlic

**Best prep:** Sliced into rounds and oven-roasted at 375°F for 15–20 minutes (becomes sweet and mellow, like roasted leeks). Oven-confit in olive oil at 250°F for 45 minutes (stores 2–3 weeks refrigerated). Raw sliced like scallions.

**Why it says "spring":** Extremely seasonal spring ingredient — available only March–June. Highly coveted in farm-to-table circles.

**Sourcing:** Not carried by major distributors. **$8–$15/lb** from farmers' markets and specialty sources. Siena Farms grows green garlic (available late April–May). Very limited volume.

**Cost per portion:** **$0.31–$1.25** for 1–2 oz accent portion. Too expensive and rare for a primary component.

**Hold time:** Raw 5–7 days refrigerated. Confit 2–3 weeks in oil. Good for the format.

**Competitor uniqueness:** Nobody uses it. **Best as a seasonal accent ingredient in an LTO sauce or dressing** — not viable as a signature anchor due to sourcing constraints and cost.

## Part 2: The shortlist — three complete menu concepts

### PICK #1: THE RADISH (watermelon + French breakfast varieties)

This is the recommendation. The radish prepared three ways gives Livite a signature spring item that no competitor can claim, at the lowest ingredient cost of any candidate, with the best hold times for fast-casual service.

**The salad: "Spring Radish Three Ways"**

All components:
- Mixed greens base (already in house)
- **Oven-roasted French breakfast radish halves** — golden-brown, sweet, warm or room temp (3–4 halved radishes per portion)
- **Raw shaved watermelon radish** — paper-thin rounds on mandoline showing hot-pink interior (4–5 slices per portion)
- **Quick-pickled red radish coins** — bright fuchsia, tangy, crunchy (1 oz portion)
- Shaved cucumber ribbons (already in house)
- Toasted pepitas (¼ oz)
- Fresh mint leaves and dill fronds
- **Dressing: Sumac-Lemon Yogurt** (the tangy Mediterranean base harmonizes with all three radish preparations — the yogurt tempers raw radish's bite, the sumac bridges to roasted sweetness, the lemon lifts the pickled radish)
- **Protein pairing: Chickpeas** (primary) or falafel. The Mediterranean flavor lane reinforces the Sumac-Lemon Yogurt and positions the salad as distinctly Livite — not a Sweetgreen clone.
- **Target price: $13.99** (positions $3.49 above current Livite salads, justified by signature preparation and three distinct vegetable techniques — still $2+ below Sweetgreen's average)

**Estimated food cost for radish components only:** $0.45–$0.85 per salad (blended across three prep methods). Total plate food cost including greens, dressing, protein, garnish: approximately $3.50–$4.50. At $13.99 menu price, food cost runs **25–32%** — healthy margin.

**How it works as a grain bowl component:** Farro base + oven-roasted radish halves + quick-pickled radish coins + chickpeas + cucumber + fresh herbs + Lemon-Herb Tahini dressing. The roasted radishes become the warm anchor element (replacing the role roasted sweet potato plays in fall/winter). The pickled radishes add acid and color. Drop the raw shaved watermelon radish in bowls to maintain the visual signature.

**How it works in a wrap:** Panini-pressed wrap with hummus spread, roasted radish halves, raw shaved watermelon radish rounds, arugula or mixed greens, quick-pickled radish, cucumber, crumbled feta or falafel, Green Goddess drizzle. The panini press warms and crisps the wrap while the radish fillings provide hot-sweet (roasted), cool-crunchy (raw), and tangy-bright (pickled) contrasts in every bite.

**Batch prep instructions for 25 portions:**

Morning prep (total active time: ~35 minutes):
1. **Quick-pickled radishes** (do 2x/week, Monday and Thursday): Slice 2 lbs red radishes into thin coins on mandoline. Combine 2 cups rice vinegar, 2 tbsp sugar, 1 tbsp salt, warm to dissolve. Pour over radishes in deli containers. Ready in 30 minutes, holds 2+ weeks refrigerated. This step takes 10 minutes and produces enough for 50+ portions.
2. **Oven-roasted French breakfast radishes** (daily): Halve 3 lbs French breakfast radishes lengthwise. Toss with 2 tbsp olive oil, salt, pepper on two sheet pans. Single layer, cut-side down. Roast at 425°F for 25 minutes until golden-brown and tender. Cool on pans. Transfer to hotel pan, hold at room temperature or refrigerated. **Active time: 10 minutes. Oven time: 25 minutes.**
3. **Raw shaved watermelon radish** (daily): Slice 2–3 watermelon radishes on mandoline into paper-thin rounds. Store in deli containers lined with damp paper towels, refrigerated. Holds 6–8 hours on cold line. **Active time: 5–8 minutes.**
4. **Portion into line containers.** Roasted radishes in one sixth-pan (room temp or cold). Pickled radishes in one sixth-pan (cold). Shaved watermelon radish in one sixth-pan (cold). **Active time: 5 minutes.**

**The Instagram moment:** The watermelon radish cross-section is the hero shot. When a customer slices into a salad and reveals paper-thin rounds of hot-pink watermelon radish layered against golden roasted halves and fuchsia pickled coins, the color contrast is extraordinary — magenta, gold, and electric pink against green. Livite should photograph the mandoline-slicing moment for Stories/Reels (the reveal of the pink interior is inherently dramatic). The hashtag writes itself: **#RadishThreeWays** or **#SpringAtLivite**. Consider a clear bowl or plate presentation where the watermelon radish slices are visible from the side.

---

### PICK #2: ASPARAGUS

**The salad: "Spring Asparagus + Herb Salad"**

All components:
- Arugula and mixed greens base
- **Oven-roasted asparagus spears** — charred tips, cut into 2–3" segments, served at room temperature (5–6 segments per portion)
- **Raw shaved asparagus ribbons** — food processor or mandoline, bright green, slightly bitter crunch (1 oz per portion)
- Shaved Parmesan or marinated white beans for richness
- Toasted almonds or pine nuts (¼ oz)
- Lemon zest
- Fresh basil and chives
- **Dressing: Basil Pesto** (thinned slightly with olive oil — the classic Italian spring combination. Alternatively, Lemon-Herb Toss for a lighter option.)
- **Protein pairing: Tofu** (marinated, oven-baked) or chickpeas. The herbal/Italian lane differentiates from the radish salad's Mediterranean profile.
- **Target price: $14.49** (asparagus carries a premium perception that justifies the highest price point on the spring menu)

**How it works as a grain bowl:** Quinoa base + roasted asparagus segments + cherry tomatoes + avocado + tofu + Basil Pesto or Chimichurri. The asparagus spears stand upright in the bowl for architectural drama.

**How it works in a wrap:** Panini-pressed wrap with Basil Pesto spread, roasted asparagus spears (laid lengthwise), raw shaved asparagus, avocado, mixed greens, sun-dried tomato, chickpeas. The long spear shape works naturally inside a wrap's linear format.

**Batch prep for 25 portions:**
1. Trim 5 lbs asparagus (snap woody ends). Toss with olive oil, salt, pepper on two sheet pans. Roast at 425°F for 12–15 minutes. Cool. Cut into segments. Hold cold or room temp. **Active: 12 minutes. Oven: 15 minutes.**
2. Shave 1.5 lbs asparagus into ribbons using food processor shredding disc or mandoline. Store cold with damp towel. **Active: 8 minutes.**
3. Total active time: ~20 minutes plus 15 minutes oven.

**The Instagram moment:** Long, whole roasted asparagus spears arranged like a crown or fan across the top of the salad, with delicate shaved ribbons curling underneath. The char marks from roasting photograph dramatically against the bright green. Asparagus is one of the most "fine dining" vegetables — it elevates Livite's perceived quality.

---

### PICK #3: SUGAR SNAP PEAS

**The salad: "Snap Pea Crunch"**

All components:
- Mixed greens and baby spinach base
- **Raw bias-cut snap peas** — sliced at a steep angle into elongated ovals, revealing interior peas (2–3 oz per portion)
- **Oven-blistered whole snap peas** — roasted at 450°F for 8–10 minutes until charred in spots, served at room temperature (1–2 oz per portion)
- Shaved red onion (already in house)
- Fresh mint leaves (whole, torn)
- Crumbled feta or goat cheese
- **Topper: Pistachio-Herb Crunch** (the mint-parsley-pistachio crumble adds textural contrast to the snap peas' crunch — double crunch effect)
- **Dressing: Lemon-Mint Vinaigrette** (thin, bright, amplifies the fresh-green lane)
- **Protein pairing: Falafel** (the crunch-on-crunch concept ties the whole plate together) or tofu
- **Target price: $12.99** (snap peas don't carry the same premium perception as asparagus, so price at the entry point of the target range)

**How it works as a grain bowl:** Farro or brown rice base + raw bias-cut snap peas + blistered snap peas + avocado + falafel + cucumber + Green Goddess dressing. The snap peas add the textural crunch that bowls often lack.

**How it works in a wrap:** Panini-pressed wrap with hummus, raw snap peas (halved lengthwise), mixed greens, cucumber, red onion, feta, Pistachio-Herb Crunch topper, Lemon-Mint Vinaigrette. The snap peas maintain their crunch even inside a pressed wrap — they don't wilt or go soggy.

**Batch prep for 25 portions:**
1. De-string and bias-cut 3 lbs snap peas for raw portions. Store in deli containers, refrigerated. **Active: 12 minutes.**
2. De-string 1.5 lbs snap peas, toss whole with olive oil, salt. Roast at 450°F for 8–10 minutes until blistered. Cool. Hold at room temperature or cold. **Active: 5 minutes. Oven: 10 minutes.**
3. Total active time: ~17 minutes plus 10 minutes oven. **Fastest total prep of all three picks.**

**The Instagram moment:** The bias-cut reveals the tiny peas nestled inside the pod — the cross-section is unexpectedly beautiful. A close-up shot of the cut snap peas against the Pistachio-Herb Crunch crumble creates a textural tableau. The blistered, charred whole pods laid across the top add drama. For video content, the audible *snap* of breaking a pod generates satisfying ASMR-style engagement.

## Part 3: The dark horse — kohlrabi

**The pick:** Purple kohlrabi, served raw as matchsticks or thin ribbons via food processor julienne disc.

**Why it's worth testing despite being unconventional:** Kohlrabi is the most genuinely unknown vegetable on this list — most customers have never eaten it, and many can't identify it. But raw kohlrabi tastes like a cross between a crisp apple and a mild broccoli stem, with a sweet, clean crunch that surprises everyone who tries it. It delivers what may be the single best textural experience of any raw vegetable: dense, juicy, snappy, and refreshing. Operationally, it's a dream — **raw kohlrabi holds 6–8+ hours on a cold line without any quality loss**, one of the longest hold times of any fresh vegetable. The food processor julienne disc produces 25 portions of matchsticks in under 5 minutes. At **$0.28–$0.63 per portion** after trim, it's very affordable.

The purple variety provides striking visual contrast: deep violet skin with creamy white interior, creating a two-tone effect when partially peeled or cut into wedges. Nobody in Boston fast-casual — not Sweetgreen, CAVA, Life Alive, or Clover — uses kohlrabi in any form. This would be a genuine first-mover advantage.

Kohlrabi also aligns with the 2026 "forgotten vegetables" trend identified by multiple industry forecasters. TNI Restaurant Consultants and Malou.io both highlight turnips, sunchokes, and kohlrabi-adjacent root vegetables as defining the next wave of vegetable-forward dining.

**How to introduce it to unfamiliar customers:** Lead with taste, not name. The menu description should say something like: *"Crispy kohlrabi — tastes like an apple met a broccoli stem. Trust us."* Offer bite-sized samples at the counter during launch week. Train staff with a one-liner: "It's in the broccoli family but tastes like a crisp apple — try a matchstick." The purple skin makes it visually intriguing enough that customers will ask about it, creating a natural conversation and staff engagement opportunity.

**Suggested test format:** Add purple kohlrabi matchsticks as a **limited-time component in an existing grain bowl** for two weeks. Track customer feedback and reorder rates. If reception is positive, consider elevating to a spring slaw base (kohlrabi matchsticks + shaved watermelon radish + snap peas + Lemon-Mint Vinaigrette) that could anchor a future menu item.

**Sourcing:** Available through Baldor and Sid Wainer from Texas and California. Bunched cartons at $26 per 24-count. Not a standard Sysco item — establish the specialty distributor relationship. Local farms grow it May–November.

The radish three-ways concept gives Livite a spring signature that is visually unforgettable, operationally bulletproof, and competitively uncontested in the Brookline market. It costs less per portion than any other candidate, holds longer on the line, and tells a story that customers will want to share. Test it Monday and build the spring menu around it.
