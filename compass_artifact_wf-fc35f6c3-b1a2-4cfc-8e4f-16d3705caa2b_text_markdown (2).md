# Livite smoothie menu audit: from 24 SKUs to 15 for Spring 2026

Livite's smoothie program is healthy but bloated. The top 6 items account for **73% of organic (non-Uber, non-BOGO) demand**, while the bottom 10 items combined generate fewer weekly units than Nutty Professor alone. The path forward: cut 9 underperformers, keep 12 permanent core items plus Make Your Own, maintain 2 seasonal rotation slots, and implement a two-tier pricing structure at **$8.95/$9.95**. This tightens the menu from 24 to 15 active SKUs, eliminates ingredient waste from dead items, reduces prep complexity, and sharpens identity — all without sacrificing meaningful revenue.

The Brookline smoothie market is getting more competitive (BARE Blends just opened in Coolidge Corner, Life Alive operates nearby), but Livite's positioning is strong. Walk-in average revenue of $9.02/unit sits comfortably above Life Alive's $7.00–$8.25 range and well below Juice Press territory. The bigger opportunity is structural: reorganizing an unguided flat list into categorized, scannable architecture that helps customers choose faster and steers them toward higher-margin items.

## The overlap problem is costing you speed and inventory dollars

Six distinct overlap clusters exist within the current 24-item menu, each containing items that cannibalize siblings without occupying unique flavor territory.

**Cluster 1 — Peanut butter + dates base (3 items).** Nutty Professor, Healthy Elvis, and PB&J all share the same dates-oat milk-peanut butter foundation. However, each earns its keep: Nutty Professor adds chocolate/coffee for a mocha-PB profile, Healthy Elvis strips to banana simplicity, and PB&J pivots to berries. These three are different enough to coexist, and all three rank in the non-Uber top 9. **No cuts needed here.**

**Cluster 2 — Mixed berry + banana (3 items).** Boston Bulldog (strawberry-blueberry-protein), Row the Charles (mixed berries-chia-almond milk), and Strawberry Banana (just… strawberry and banana) all compete for the same berry-fruit customer. Boston Bulldog wins the protein angle. Row the Charles wins the superfood-berry angle with chia seeds and blackberries. **Strawberry Banana is the casualty** — it's a commodity product every competitor sells for less, it generates only 437 total units with zero BOGO support, and any customer who wants it can approximate it through Make Your Own.

**Cluster 3 — Tropical fruit base (3 items).** Live Right (mango-pineapple-goji-coconut), Pina Colada (pineapple-banana-coconut), and Dr. Green Mango (mango-pineapple-orange-spinach) all live in tropical territory. Live Right is the full-featured tropical with goji berries. Pina Colada is a stripped-down version with nearly identical ingredients minus the mango and goji — and at **$8.24/unit**, it's the lowest revenue-per-unit non-seasonal item on the menu. Dr. Green Mango differentiates with spinach and orange. **Pina Colada gets cut.** Anyone craving coconut-pineapple can order Live Right or build their own.

**Cluster 4 — Coffee + dates (3 items).** Java Twist, Coffee Cake, and Buenos Dias are all dates-coffee-vanilla smoothies with minor variations. Java Twist leads with 376 units and the cleanest recipe (almonds, coconut milk). Coffee Cake adds granola and walnuts for 293 units — unique ingredients that only this item uses. Buenos Dias is dead at 48 units. **Cut Coffee Cake and Buenos Dias.** Java Twist becomes the sole coffee flagship. For customers who want coffee + chocolate (the Buenos Dias profile), point them to Nutty Professor blended with coffee — which many already order.

**Cluster 5 — Vanilla-cream dates (2 items).** Vanilla Cream (238 units) and Creamsicle (18 units) share a dates-vanilla-coconut milk base. Vanilla Cream is essentially a base recipe without a hook. Creamsicle adds orange but has nearly zero demand. **Cut both.** Neither occupies unique territory that justifies inventory or menu space.

**Cluster 6 — Baked goods/granola (3 items).** Blueberry Muffin, Cinnamon Roll, and Lemon Chia all use the granola-dates-vanilla framework. Blueberry Muffin is the strongest at 682 total units but is **69% BOGO-dependent** — only ~212 non-Uber units over 91 days. Cinnamon Roll works as a seasonal. Lemon Chia is essentially dead at 73 units. **Cut Lemon Chia. Rework Blueberry Muffin. Keep Cinnamon Roll as a winter seasonal.**

## Cut list: 9 items to remove immediately

**1. Strawberry Banana — CUT**
Why: Generic commodity product. 437 units total, ~280 non-Uber (~22/week). Every smoothie chain in America sells this for less. Adds nothing to Livite's brand identity. Overlaps directly with Row the Charles and Boston Bulldog.
Merge path: Customers migrate to Row the Charles (berry upgrade) or Build Your Own.
Risk: Minimal. No loyal niche — this is the "I don't know what to order" default that Make Your Own handles better.

**2. Pina Colada — CUT**
Why: 348 units total, **$8.24/unit** (lowest revenue per unit of any non-seasonal). Stripped-down overlap with Live Right. Coconut flakes and agave are the only differentiators, and neither justifies a dedicated SKU.
Merge path: Live Right absorbs this demand. Add coconut flakes as a Make Your Own topping option.
Risk: Low. Some tropical loyalists may miss the simpler coconut profile, but Live Right is the better product.

**3. Coffee Cake — CUT**
Why: 293 units, overlaps with Java Twist. Requires unique inventory (walnuts, coffee protein) that no other smoothie uses. Those walnuts and that coffee protein serve exactly one item selling 23 units/week.
Merge path: Java Twist is the coffee flagship. Add cinnamon granola as an optional boost if customers want the Coffee Cake angle.
Risk: Low. 293 units will mostly migrate to Java Twist, which already outsells it.

**4. Vanilla Cream — CUT**
Why: 238 units. No defining characteristic — it's dates, almonds, coconut milk, and vanilla. That's a base recipe, not a product. Zero BOGO support means this is pure organic demand, but 238 units over 91 days is only **18 units/week**.
Merge path: No direct replacement needed. This audience either wants a simple sweet smoothie (Healthy Elvis) or something custom (Make Your Own).
Risk: Very low. Small but real audience of ~18/week who like simplicity. They'll find alternatives.

**5. Buenos Dias — CUT**
Why: 48 units total. Dead. That's **3.7 smoothies per week**. The coffee-banana-cocoa profile is already served by ordering Nutty Professor with coffee (which thousands already do).
Merge path: Nutty Professor with coffee swap.
Risk: None.

**6. Creamsicle — CUT**
Why: 18 units total over 91 days. Functionally discontinued already — fewer than 1.4 orders per week. The orange-vanilla-dates profile is pleasant but has found zero audience.
Merge path: None needed at this volume.
Risk: None.

**7. Blue Mango — CUT**
Why: 8 units total. This item effectively doesn't exist. $7.88/unit is also the lowest price point on the menu, suggesting it may be an old item that was never properly removed.
Merge path: Dr. Green Mango covers the mango territory comprehensively.
Risk: None.

**8. Lemon Chia — CUT**
Why: 73 units (5.6/week). The lemon-chia-granola profile is unique but has no audience. Requires lemon extract — a single-use ingredient.
Merge path: Could be reincarnated as a spring/summer seasonal if reformulated. But as a permanent menu item, it doesn't earn its slot.
Risk: Very low. Tiny but passionate audience may notice its absence.

**9. Pistachio Protein — CUT (from permanent menu)**
Why: 30 units over 91 days (2.3/week). Despite pistachio being a trending ingredient nationally, this formulation isn't connecting. Pistachios are also among the most expensive nuts in your inventory.
Merge path: Recommend reformulating and relaunching as a seasonal or LTO to test demand with better positioning and marketing support. The concept has potential — the execution needs work.
Risk: Negligible at current volume. But pistachio is genuinely trending, so consider a seasonal relaunch with a reworked recipe (see Rework section).

**Revenue impact of cuts:** These 9 items generated approximately **$14,800 combined over 91 days** — roughly 8% of smoothie revenue. However, most of that demand (~70%) will migrate to remaining menu items, not disappear entirely. Net revenue loss estimate: **$4,000–$5,000 per quarter**, easily offset by improved operational speed, reduced ingredient waste, and better staff execution on remaining items.

## Keep list: 10 untouchable core items

These are ranked by organic demand signal strength, not BOGO-inflated totals.

**1. Nutty Professor — Non-negotiable flagship**
Non-Uber: 3,172 units (26.7% share, 244/week). This smoothie IS Livite's smoothie program. Nearly **3x the organic demand of the #2 item**. Only 2% BOGO, meaning demand is almost entirely genuine. The dates-chocolate-PB-oat milk profile is a masterclass in indulgent-but-clean. The coffee option adds versatility. Do not change this recipe. Ever.

**2. Healthy Elvis — Anchor of the PB trio**
Non-Uber: 1,148 units (9.7%, 88/week). High BOGO dependency (70%) is a flag, but **88 organic units/week is still massive** — more than any item below #5 on the list. The banana-PB-dates combo is timeless and has the lowest ingredient complexity of any top seller. Sub-30-second prep time.

**3. Row the Charles — The real organic #3**
Non-Uber: 956 units (8.0%, 74/week). This item climbs from #5 overall to #3 when you strip out BOGO distortion — a signal that walk-in and organic online customers genuinely choose it. The Boston-specific name builds brand. Berry-chia-almond milk is clean, photogenic, and on-trend. Zero BOGO dependency.

**4. Dr. Green Mango — Unique tropical-green crossover**
Non-Uber: 854 units (7.2%, 66/week). Occupies rare flavor territory by bridging tropical fruit (mango, pineapple, orange) with greens (spinach). No other item does this. Good entry point for customers who want greens but fear the taste. Moderate BOGO (37%) suggests genuine organic demand is the primary driver.

**5. Grasshopper — Signature identity item**
Non-Uber: 822 units (6.9%, 63/week). This is Livite's most "ownable" smoothie — mint chocolate chip that's secretly a green smoothie. The story sells itself. Customers who discover spinach is the green ingredient become evangelists. Low BOGO (27%). This item should be prominently featured in marketing.

**6. Boston Bulldog — Berry protein workhorse**
Non-Uber: 734 units (6.2%, 57/week). The only top-6 item with vanilla vegan protein as a core ingredient, giving it an inherent protein positioning. Heavy BOGO (69%) is a concern — if Uber Eats promos end, total volume drops significantly. But **57 organic units/week is still strong enough to keep.** The local name reinforces Boston identity.

**7. Green Energy — Matcha wellness essential**
Non-Uber: 603 units (5.1%, 46/week). The only matcha item on the menu, and matcha searches are up **800% year-over-year** according to Yelp data. Zero BOGO means every unit is organic demand. The banana-apple-matcha-spinach-kale profile is the most nutrient-dense smoothie on the menu. This item's demand is likely to grow in 2026.

**8. Live Right — Tropical category anchor**
Non-Uber: 575 units (4.8%, 44/week). After cutting Pina Colada, Live Right becomes the sole tropical offering. Mango-pineapple-banana-goji-coconut milk covers the entire tropical flavor wheel. Low BOGO (4%) confirms organic demand.

**9. PB&J — The berry-PB bridge**
Non-Uber: 455 units (3.8%, 35/week). This item justifies its slot by occupying the intersection of the PB cluster and the berry cluster. No other smoothie combines peanut butter with mixed berries. Low BOGO (3%) means this is pure organic. If PB&J were cut, some demand would go to Nutty Professor and some to Row the Charles, but neither fully replaces the PB+berry combination.

**10. Java Twist — Coffee category anchor**
Non-Uber: ~330 units (~25/week estimated from total 376 at 1% BOGO). After cutting Coffee Cake and Buenos Dias, Java Twist becomes the sole coffee smoothie. Coffee-smoothie hybrids are a **major national growth trend** — Jamba just launched blended coffees in late 2024, Smoothie King's coffee blends are top sellers, and the coffee-smoothie crossover captures morning and afternoon dayparts. At **$10.39/unit**, Java Twist commands the highest revenue per unit of any non-BOGO-heavy item. This is a premium product earning premium prices.

## Rework candidates: 3 items that need surgery

**Blueberry Muffin → Rework recipe, reduce BOGO dependency**
Current state: 682 total units, but **69% BOGO-dependent**. Strips to roughly 212 non-Uber units (16/week). That's borderline cut territory, but the "baked goods as smoothie" concept is genuinely differentiated and aligns with national trends (Tropical Smoothie's Biscoff Apple Pie is a hit, "dessert-inspired" smoothies are growing).

What to change: The current recipe (dates, oat milk, blueberries, cinnamon granola, lemon juice, vanilla vegan protein) is solid but underpowered. Add **real vanilla extract and a pinch of nutmeg** to amplify the muffin flavor. Drop the lemon juice — it muddies the baked-goods profile. Consider adding **oat flour or rolled oats** for texture and to reinforce the muffin concept. The protein already present helps justify a premium price point. Most importantly, **reduce BOGO promotion frequency for this item** on Uber Eats to build organic demand. Test it for 90 days without BOGO support — if organic demand doesn't reach 25+/week, cut it in the summer review.

**Strawberry Shortcake → Sharpen positioning, add texture**
Current state: 366 non-Uber units (28/week). Decent organic demand but the name promises "shortcake" while the recipe delivers a fairly standard strawberry-dates-granola-coconut smoothie. The gap between name and experience is a missed opportunity.

What to change: Lean into the shortcake promise. Add a **crumbled vanilla cookie or shortbread element** as a topping or blend-in, or increase the granola quantity and add a small amount of vanilla cake-flavored protein. The goal is making customers say "this actually tastes like strawberry shortcake." Consider offering it as a **thicker, spoonable consistency** (like a shake) to further differentiate from the berry smoothies. At 28 organic units/week, this item is safe enough to experiment with — rework for spring launch and evaluate by July.

**Make Your Own → Restructure as "Build Your Own" with guided tiers**
Current state: 145 units (11/week). Low volume but this isn't really a "smoothie" — it's a customization option. The issue isn't demand, it's structure.

What to change: Implement a **three-step build process** displayed on the menu board: (1) Choose your base milk, (2) Choose 3 fruits/veggies, (3) Add boosts (+$1–$2 each for protein, chia, matcha, cacao, goji berries, etc.). This transforms Build Your Own from a confusing blank slate into a guided experience, increases average ticket through boost upsells, and serves as the "catch-all" for anyone who misses a cut item. Price the base at $8.95 with boosts at $1.50 each. A customer adding protein and chia hits $11.95 — your highest walk-in price point.

---

## Pricing strategy: move to two tiers at $8.95 and $9.95

**The case against flat pricing.** Your ingredient costs vary significantly. A Strawberry Shortcake (strawberries, dates, granola, coconut milk) costs materially less to make than a Java Twist (coffee, almonds, dates, coconut milk) or a Green Energy (matcha, almonds, banana, apple, spinach, kale, oat milk). Flat pricing either underprices premium items or overprices simple ones. Coffee and matcha cost more; protein costs more. Customers understand and accept that.

**Recommended walk-in pricing structure:**

| Tier | Price | Items |
|------|-------|-------|
| **Classic** | **$8.95** | Row the Charles, Dr. Green Mango, Live Right, Strawberry Shortcake, PB&J, Blueberry Muffin, Healthy Elvis |
| **Premium** | **$9.95** | Nutty Professor, Boston Bulldog (protein), Grasshopper, Green Energy (matcha), Java Twist (coffee) |
| **Build Your Own** | **$8.95 base** | +$1.50 per boost (protein, matcha, chia, cacao, goji, etc.) |
| **Seasonal** | **$9.95** | Rotating items priced at premium to signal specialness |

**Why $8.95/$9.95 specifically.** Your current walk-in average is $9.02. A two-tier system at $8.95/$9.95 maintains this average (weighted by volume, the mix skews toward premium since Nutty Professor, your #1 by far, is in the premium tier). You sit above Life Alive ($7.00–$8.25), match Pressed Cafe ($8.95), and stay well below Juice Press ($10.92+). For Brookline — affluent but not downtown, college-adjacent but not campus — this range signals quality without triggering sticker shock.

**Coffee smoothies absolutely deserve a premium.** Coffee is an expensive ingredient, customers already associate coffee beverages with $5–$7 price points (Starbucks anchor), and Java Twist already commands $10.39/unit blended across channels. Pricing it at $9.95 walk-in is justified and expected.

**Protein smoothies deserve a premium.** Nationally, protein smoothies command **$1–$2 premiums** at every major chain. Tropical Smoothie's new premium protein LTOs are priced above standard, and Smoothie King's Gladiator line prices above base. Boston Bulldog already includes vanilla vegan protein; Green Energy already includes almonds. Customers paying $9.95 for a protein smoothie feel they're getting value, not getting gouged.

**Third-party delivery pricing:** Maintain **20–25% markup** over walk-in. Classic items at $10.95–$11.25, Premium items at $11.95–$12.45. This is consistent with your current Uber average of $11.15 and DoorDash average of $11.65.

## Menu architecture: from flat list to guided categories

The current flat list of 24 unnamed-category smoothies forces every customer to read the entire menu. With 200+ smoothies/day and 39% coming through Uber Eats (where scroll fatigue kills conversion), architecture matters enormously.

**Recommended category structure (15 items across 5 sections):**

**★ SIGNATURES** (3 items — your identity, listed first)
- Nutty Professor — *Chocolate peanut butter with dates. Our #1 for a reason.* — $9.95
- Grasshopper — *Mint chocolate chip. Secretly green. Always delicious.* — $9.95
- Healthy Elvis — *Banana, peanut butter, dates. Simple. Perfect.* — $8.95

**🍓 BERRY & BRIGHT** (3 items — fruit-forward, refreshing)
- Row the Charles — *Mixed berries, banana, chia seeds, almond milk.* — $8.95
- Boston Bulldog — *Strawberry, blueberry, banana, vanilla protein, oat milk.* — $9.95
- PB&J — *Peanut butter meets mixed berries. Childhood, upgraded.* — $8.95

**🌴 TROPICAL & GREEN** (3 items — tropical fruit meets wellness)
- Dr. Green Mango — *Mango, pineapple, orange, spinach. Tropical with a green twist.* — $8.95
- Live Right — *Mango, pineapple, banana, goji berries, coconut milk.* — $8.95
- Green Energy — *Matcha, banana, apple, spinach, kale, almonds, oat milk.* — $9.95

**🍫 INDULGENT CLASSICS** (2 items — dessert-inspired)
- Blueberry Muffin — *Tastes like the muffin. Blueberries, cinnamon granola, vanilla protein.* — $8.95
- Strawberry Shortcake — *Strawberries, dates, vanilla, granola, coconut milk.* — $8.95

**☕ COFFEE BLEND** (1 item — caffeine meets smoothie)
- Java Twist — *Cold brew, dates, vanilla, almonds, coconut milk.* — $9.95

**🔧 BUILD YOUR OWN** — $8.95 base + boosts ($1.50 each)

**🌟 SEASONAL SPECIALS** (2 rotating slots) — $9.95

**Why this architecture works.** "Signatures" at the top anchors the menu in Livite's strongest, most differentiated products and catches the 40% of customers who order the first interesting thing they see. Category names are intuitive without being clinical. Short flavor descriptors answer the #1 customer question ("what does this taste like?") without requiring ingredient lists for the initial scan. Premium items are distributed across categories so every section has a $9.95 anchor. The three indulgent items in Signatures + Indulgent Classics won't feel like an overwhelming sugar wall because they're split across sections.

**On delivery platforms**, mirror this exact category structure. Uber Eats and DoorDash both support menu categories. Your #1 item (Nutty Professor) should appear in the "Popular" or "Most Ordered" section automatically, but placing it first within Signatures ensures new customers see it immediately.

---

## Seasonal rotation strategy: 2 slots, 4 seasons, clear rules

Maintain **2 seasonal slots** that rotate quarterly, priced at $9.95 to signal "special" and protect margin on experimental items.

**Recommended seasonal calendar:**

| Season | Slot 1 | Slot 2 |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **Spring (Mar–May)** | Pistachio Protein (reformulated — see below) | Lemon Berry Chia (reworked Lemon Chia) |
| **Summer (Jun–Aug)** | Watermelon Mint or Tropical Coconut Crunch | Mango Lassi (trending nationally, +13% on menus) |
| **Fall (Sep–Nov)** | Pumpkin Spice or Apple Cinnamon | Chai Latte Smoothie |
| **Winter (Dec–Feb)** | Cinnamon Roll (proven performer) | Candy Cane or Gingerbread |

**Rules for seasonal items.** Every seasonal must use at least **3 ingredients already in permanent menu inventory** to minimize waste and new supplier needs. If a seasonal item exceeds 40 units/week for a full quarter, it earns consideration for permanent promotion (the Tropical Smoothie model of testing LTOs and promoting winners). If it falls below 15 units/week after 4 weeks, pull it early and replace.

**Spring 2026 specific recommendations:** Relaunch Pistachio Protein with a reworked recipe — increase the pistachio quantity, add a small amount of cardamom or rose water for a Middle Eastern–inspired twist, use vanilla oat milk as the base, and call it **"Pistachio Dream."** Pistachio is a genuinely trending flavor in 2025–2026 (pistachio lattes, pistachio gelato, pistachio everything) and the original's failure was likely a positioning and formulation problem, not a concept problem. For the second slot, reformulate Lemon Chia as **"Lemon Berry Chia"** — add strawberries to the lemon-chia-dates base for a spring-appropriate bright flavor that bridges the gap between the original's tartness and something more broadly appealing.

---

## What the market says you should be thinking about next

Three trends deserve development attention beyond this immediate audit.

**Protein forward positioning.** Nationally, **60% of consumers are actively seeking more protein**, and the protein smoothie segment is growing at 7% annually. Livite already has protein in Boston Bulldog and Blueberry Muffin, but doesn't call it out. Consider adding **protein content callouts** (e.g., "20g protein") next to every item that contains protein on the menu board and delivery listings. This costs nothing and immediately captures the protein-seeking customer. Longer term, develop a dedicated high-protein smoothie (30g+ plant protein) for the core menu — this is a gap that national chains like Smoothie King and Tropical Smoothie are aggressively filling.

**Boost/enhancer upsell system.** Every major smoothie chain offers paid add-ons: protein boost ($1.50–$2.50), matcha shot ($2.00), chia seeds ($1.00), adaptogens ($1.50). Livite should formalize this. A simple "Add a boost" section on the menu with 5–6 options at $1.50 each could add **$0.30–$0.50 to average ticket** across all smoothie orders, translating to roughly $15,000–$25,000 in incremental annual revenue at current volumes with minimal ingredient cost.

**Functional ingredients as a differentiator.** Adaptogens (ashwagandha, maca) and functional mushrooms (lion's mane, reishi) are crossing into mainstream fast-casual. Lion's mane is the **#1 preferred functional ingredient** among consumers, ranked 2x higher than ashwagandha. No competitor in the Brookline market currently offers functional mushroom smoothies. This is genuine whitespace. A "Focus" smoothie with lion's mane, matcha, banana, and oat milk — or a "Calm" smoothie with ashwagandha, cacao, dates, and almond milk — would give Livite a first-mover position in the local market and generate significant word-of-mouth among the BU and health-conscious Brookline demographic. Test as a seasonal before committing to permanent.

## Conclusion: what to do this week

The immediate action items are clear. **Remove Blue Mango, Creamsicle, Buenos Dias, and Vanilla Cream from all platforms now** — these four items have combined demand of less than 5 units/day and their removal will be noticed by almost no one. **Remove Strawberry Banana, Pina Colada, Coffee Cake, Lemon Chia, and Pistachio Protein by mid-March** with a brief "menu refresh" announcement. Implement the two-tier pricing structure ($8.95/$9.95) simultaneously with the menu reduction so the changes feel intentional and premium, not like cost-cutting. Reorganize delivery platform listings into the five-category architecture immediately — this alone should improve conversion rates by reducing scroll fatigue.

The deeper work — reworking Blueberry Muffin and Strawberry Shortcake, developing the Build Your Own guided tier system, launching Spring seasonal items, and adding a boost/enhancer upsell menu — should happen over the next 4–6 weeks. The resulting 15-item menu will be tighter, faster to execute, easier to navigate, and better positioned against both Life Alive's lower-priced offerings and the national chains' scale advantages. Livite's real competitive moat isn't price — it's the dietitian-designed credibility, clean date-sweetened formulations, and locally-named character that no chain can replicate. A focused menu lets that identity shine louder.
