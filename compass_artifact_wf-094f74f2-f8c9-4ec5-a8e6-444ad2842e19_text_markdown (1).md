# Livite snack and grab-and-go program: Spring 2026 blueprint

**Livite has a rare opening to own the grab-and-go snack category in Brookline.** No Boston-area healthy fast-casual competitor — not Sweetgreen, CAVA, Life Alive, or Dig — has built a true snack program with destination items that drive standalone visits. The GLP-1 revolution (**12% of U.S. adults now on these drugs**, doubled in 18 months) is creating unprecedented demand for high-protein, portion-controlled, grab-and-go snack formats priced at $3.50–$7.50. Livite's existing Mediterranean ingredient base, in-house baking capability, and Vitamix/food processor setup position it to launch a snack program with **75–85% gross margins** on most items — significantly above the 65–70% margin on bowls and wraps. This report provides the exact items, recipes, pricing, packaging, and equipment to execute immediately.

## 1. The competitor grab-and-go landscape has a massive gap

Across all eight target competitors, grab-and-go snacking is an afterthought. **Sweetgreen** sells rosemary focaccia ($2.95–$3.50), hummus + focaccia ($5.25), a crispy rice treat ($3.95), and third-party packaged items (Siete chips, Hu chocolate). No proprietary snack. No display case program. Their Q3 2025 same-store sales fell **9.5%** and traffic dropped **11.7%** — they're scrambling on pricing, not innovating on snacks. **CAVA** comes closest with pita chips ($2.90) and side dips ($3.55) — their Crazy Feta dip generates genuine fan devotion with dozens of copycat recipes online, but it's ordered as a bowl add-on, not a standalone grab-and-go purchase. **Life Alive** has edamame and hummus sides ($4.75) and chia pudding, but zero dedicated snack program. **Dig** sells seasonal sides ($3.89–$5.90) as meal components. **Just Salad**, **Chopt**, **Tender Greens**, and **Freshii** all treat snacks as afterthoughts — Freshii's Energii Bites ($3.49 for 3) are the most interesting template but haven't achieved cult status.

The catering picture is equally thin. Sweetgreen's catering snack add-ons are limited to chips, focaccia, and chocolate — all third-party products, none house-made. CAVA offers Chips & 1 Dip ($43 for 10 servings, $4.30/person) and Assorted Dips & Chips ($67 for 10, $6.70/person), plus cookies ($4.20 each) and brownies ($3.30 each). No protein snacks, no energy bites, no wellness-positioned items. **The white space is enormous**: no competitor offers a curated, health-forward snack add-on for corporate catering that includes protein-forward bites, grain cups, or functional items. Livite's existing catering relationships through Forkable, Cater2me, and direct accounts make this immediately actionable.

What competitors do well: CAVA's "3 dips included free" model creates massive perceived value. Sweetgreen's textural layering (crispy rice, za'atar breadcrumbs on every bowl) drives repeat purchases. Pret A Manger's "Pots" program — clear-container layered yogurt, chia, and protein items at $4.50–$7.50 — is the global gold standard for grab-and-go and should be Livite's direct model.

## 2. GLP-1 drugs are reshaping snack design requirements

The numbers are staggering. **12.4% of U.S. adults** are currently taking a GLP-1 drug like Ozempic, Wegovy, or Mounjaro — up from 5.8% in February 2024. **23% of U.S. households** now include at least one GLP-1 user, and that figure is projected to reach **35% of all food and beverage units sold** by 2030 (Circana). Morgan Stanley projects **24 million Americans** on these drugs by 2035. This isn't a niche — it's a structural shift in how Americans eat.

The behavioral data drives snack design directly. Among GLP-1 users, **93% eat smaller meals**, **74% eat fewer snacks**, and **41% order smaller portions** at restaurants. They consume **20–30% fewer daily calories** but actively increase consumption of yogurt, fresh fruit, nutrition bars, and protein-forward items. The ideal GLP-1 snack profile is now well-established: **15–20g protein** per snack (enough for muscle preservation without triggering fullness), **5g+ fiber** (Datassential calls fiber "the new protein" for 2026), **under 200 calories**, and **zero or minimal added sugar**. Texture matters enormously — GLP-1 users define "food joy" through crispy, creamy, and crunchy rather than volume.

Restaurants are scrambling to respond. Smoothie King launched 7 GLP-1 Support smoothies in October 2024 — **6% of customers purchased** in the first months. Chipotle introduced a High Protein Cup in December 2025 — a 4-oz protein serving at **$3.82**, their first-ever snack format. Subway launched Protein Pockets. Starbucks added protein lattes. **50% of all consumers** (not just GLP-1 users) express interest in menu items called out as "GLP-1 friendly." The opportunity extends far beyond actual users — the GLP-1 halo validates high-protein, portion-controlled snacking for everyone.

**What this means for Livite's snack program:** Every grab-and-go item should list protein and fiber grams prominently. Target **15–20g protein per snack item** where possible. Price the core snack tier at **$3.50–$5.99** (Chipotle's $3.82 protein cup sets the floor). Label items as "High Protein" or "GLP-1 Friendly" on display signage — this costs nothing and appeals to both actual users and the broader health-conscious market.

## 3. Pret A Manger's "Pots" model is the playbook to steal

The most successful grab-and-go snack programs share three traits: **visual appeal through clear packaging** (customers eat with their eyes first), **layered components that create texture contrast**, and **tight price architecture between $4 and $8**. Pret A Manger is the undisputed leader — their "Pret Pots" category (yogurt parfaits, chia puddings, protein pots, fruit cups) was specifically expanded to capture mid-morning and afternoon snack occasions. Every pot uses a clear round container showing colorful layers. They sell at $4.50–$7.50, with food costs under 25%.

**Highest-margin grab-and-go items** by category, based on industry data:

Energy bites/balls achieve **80–85% gross margin** — date-and-oat bases cost $0.40–$0.75 per 3-bite serving and sell for $3.50–$4.50. Overnight oats hit **78–85% margin** — food cost $0.75–$1.30 per serving, selling at $5–$8. Yogurt parfaits deliver **78–85% margin** — food cost $1.00–$1.50, selling at $6.50–$8. Chia pudding matches at **75–83% margin**. Even dip cups (hummus + vegetables) achieve **65–75% margin** at $5–$6. By comparison, Livite's bowls and wraps likely run 60–70% margins. **A grab-and-go program is structurally more profitable per item than the core menu.**

In the Boston/Brookline market specifically, Tatte charges $7.25–$9.75 for yogurt/muesli cups, $7–$8 for overnight oats, and $9–$10 for farro salad pints. Cocobeet charges $6–$8 for yogurt pots. Life Alive's chia pudding runs $6–$7. **The Brookline sweet spot for grab-and-go snacks is $5–$7 for substantial items and $3.50–$5 for impulse bites** — priced 10–15% below Tatte to capture the college crowd while maintaining premium positioning above Pret.

## 4. Eight grab-and-go items for the display case

These items are designed around Livite's existing equipment (oven, panini press, Vitamix, food processor), spring ingredient sourcing, and batch-prep workflow. Each uses ingredients already in-house or easily sourced. Items are ordered by margin, starting highest.

### Item 1: Tahini-Date Energy Bites (3-pack)

**Components:** Medjool dates, tahini, rolled oats, chia seeds, cacao nibs, pinch of sea salt, drizzle of honey. Optional: coat half the batch in crushed pistachios, half in toasted coconut for visual variety.

**Packaging:** 4 oz clear PET clamshell ($0.15–$0.30/unit) holding 3 bites. Branded sticker label with "15g Fiber | 8g Protein | Vegan" callout.

**Shelf life:** 5–7 days refrigerated; 7–14 days in walk-in; 4+ hours ambient (safe for countertop display without refrigeration).

**Price:** $4.49 | **Food cost:** ~$0.55–$0.70 per 3-pack | **Food cost %:** ~13–16% | **Gross margin: ~84–87%**

**Target persona:** BU students between classes, GLP-1 users wanting a clean snack, afternoon office workers. The grab-and-stick-in-your-bag customer.

### Item 2: Pistachio-Crunch Yogurt Cup

**Components:** Greek yogurt base (6 oz), swirl of honey, house-made pistachio-herb crunch topping (from spring R&D — roasted pistachios, herbs, olive oil, salt), fresh seasonal berries on top.

**Packaging:** 12 oz clear round PET cup with dome lid ($0.15–$0.25/unit). Pistachio crunch stored in a nested 2 oz portion cup inside the lid to keep crunchy until eating. Visible berry-yogurt-pistachio layers through clear wall.

**Target persona:** Health-conscious female professionals (25–45), students wanting a filling breakfast-on-the-go, anyone who loves Tatte's $7.25 yogurt bowl but wants it grab-and-go at the same price.

### Item 3: Turmeric-Ginger Overnight Oats

**Components:** Rolled oats, chia seeds, vanilla coconut milk (Livite already makes overnight oats with this base per Google Drive recipe), fresh ginger (grated), turmeric, maple syrup, pinch of black pepper. Top with crushed almonds and a drizzle of honey before display.

**Packaging:** 16 oz clear round PP deli container with snap lid ($0.10–$0.20/unit). Consider branded sleeve wrap for visual distinction.

**Shelf life:** 3–5 days refrigerated. Best texture days 1–2. Requires refrigerated case.

**Prep:** Mix base in large batch (enough for 30 servings): combine oats, chia, coconut milk, ginger, turmeric, maple, salt, pepper in a large Cambro. Refrigerate overnight. Next morning, portion into containers, top with almonds and honey. Full batch: 10 minutes mixing, 20 minutes portioning.

**Target persona:** The "I need breakfast and I'm late" BU student. Morning wellness enthusiasts. GLP-1 users who want a high-fiber start (oats + chia = ~8g fiber per serving). Already validated by Livite's existing overnight oats recipe — this is just a turmeric-ginger upgrade.

### Item 4: Mediterranean Hummus & Veggie Dip Cup

**Components:** House hummus (4 oz) in bottom compartment, carrot sticks, cucumber spears, red bell pepper strips, 4–5 pita chips. Optional: sprinkle of sumac and drizzle of olive oil on the hummus.

**Packaging:** 16 oz clear round container with nested 4 oz portion cup for hummus ($0.15–$0.25 total for container + portion cup + lid). Vegetables arranged vertically for visibility.

**Shelf life:** 3–4 days refrigerated (cut vegetables are limiting factor at 2–3 days for peak crispness; hummus holds 4–7 days). Requires refrigerated case.

**Price:** $5.99 | **Food cost:** ~$1.30–$1.60 (hummus $0.40, carrots $0.15, cucumber $0.15, red pepper $0.25, pita chips $0.15, packaging $0.20) | **Food cost %:** ~22–27% | **Gross margin: ~73–78%**

**Prep:** Hummus: batch-make in food processor (chickpeas, tahini, lemon, garlic, olive oil, salt). One batch yields 30+ portions in ~10 minutes. Vegetables: cut in batches, store in water in walk-in. Assembly line: 20 cups takes ~25 minutes.

**Target persona:** The mid-afternoon office worker who needs something between lunch and dinner. Students looking for a savory, satisfying snack under $6. Pairs naturally with Livite's Mediterranean identity.

### Item 5: Spring Farro Power Cup

**Components:** Cooked farro (3/4 cup), roasted chickpeas (spiced with cumin and chili — already on Livite's recipe list), diced red bell pepper, crumbled feta, fresh herbs (parsley + mint), squeeze of lemon, drizzle of herb vinaigrette (Livite's house dressing).

**Packaging:** 12 oz clear round PET container with flat lid ($0.12–$0.20/unit). Herb vinaigrette in a 2 oz portion cup on the side.

**Shelf life:** 3–4 days refrigerated. Farro holds texture well. Requires refrigerated case.

**Price:** $7.99 | **Food cost:** ~$1.85–$2.25 (farro $0.30, chickpeas $0.20, red pepper $0.20, feta $0.35, herbs $0.15, lemon $0.05, vinaigrette $0.15, container $0.20) | **Food cost %:** ~23–28% | **Gross margin: ~72–77%**

**Prep:** Farro: cook in large batch (1 hour simmer, yields 40+ portions). Chickpeas: roast on sheet pan in oven, 25 minutes at 400°F. Assembly: 20 cups in ~30 minutes. All ingredients are already in Livite's supply chain.

**Target persona:** The lunch-skip crowd — office workers who want something more than a snack but less than a full bowl ($12.99–$14.99). GLP-1 users wanting a high-protein (18g), high-fiber (9g) mini-meal. College athletes needing a pre-practice fuel cup. This is your **$8 price anchor** — the most substantial grab-and-go item.

### Item 6: Honey-Sumac Almond Clusters

**Components:** Raw almonds, honey, sumac, pinch of sea salt, touch of olive oil. Bake on sheet pan in oven at 325°F until golden and clustered.

**Packaging:** Small kraft bag with clear window ($0.05–$0.15/unit) or 4 oz clear clamshell. Branded sticker. **Ambient-stable — no refrigeration needed.** Can sit on countertop display.

**Shelf life:** 2–3 weeks in sealed packaging at room temperature.

**Price:** $3.99 (3 oz bag) | **Food cost:** ~$0.65–$0.85 (almonds $0.45, honey $0.10, sumac $0.05, packaging $0.10) | **Food cost %:** ~16–21% | **Gross margin: ~79–84%**

**Prep:** Toss almonds with honey, sumac, salt, olive oil. Spread on parchment-lined sheet pan. Bake 325°F for 12–15 minutes, stirring once. Let cool completely — they'll cluster naturally. Break into pieces. One sheet pan yields ~15 bags. Total active time: 5 minutes. Bake alongside cookies during existing oven time.

**Target persona:** The impulse buyer at checkout. Students who want a $4 snack to toss in their bag. This is Livite's answer to CAVA's pita chips ($2.90) but elevated and proprietary. Sumac is the 2026 trending Mediterranean ingredient — CAVA just launched Sumac Sour Cream & Onion Pita Chips as an LTO, validating the flavor.

### Item 7: Chocolate-Tahini Chia Pudding

**Components:** Chia seeds, coconut milk, cacao powder, tahini swirl, maple syrup, topped with cacao nibs and a sprinkle of sea salt.

**Packaging:** 8 oz clear round cup with snap lid ($0.10–$0.15/unit). Visible dark layers with contrasting tahini swirl through clear wall. Dome lid if topped with cacao nibs.

**Shelf life:** 3–5 days refrigerated. Requires refrigerated case.

**Price:** $5.99 | **Food cost:** ~$0.75–$1.00 (chia $0.15, coconut milk $0.20, cacao $0.10, tahini $0.10, maple $0.05, cacao nibs $0.10, container $0.12) | **Food cost %:** ~13–17% | **Gross margin: ~83–87%**

**Prep:** Vitamix or whisk: blend coconut milk, cacao powder, maple syrup. Pour over chia seeds in large Cambro, stir well. Refrigerate 4+ hours or overnight. Portion into cups, swirl in tahini with a spoon, top with cacao nibs and salt. Batch of 20: ~10 minutes active, 4 hours passive.

**Target persona:** The "I want something sweet but healthy" customer. Vegan dessert seekers. Chocolate lovers who want a guilt-free treat. This is Livite's answer to Life Alive's chia pudding but with the tahini-chocolate Mediterranean twist no competitor offers.

### Item 8: Roasted Chickpea Crunch Cups

**Components:** Oven-roasted chickpeas seasoned three ways (rotate): (A) Za'atar + lemon zest, (B) Turmeric + black pepper + honey, (C) Sumac + garlic. Serve in individual portion cups.

**Packaging:** 4 oz clear portion cup with lid ($0.05–$0.10/unit) or small kraft snack bag. **Ambient-stable — no refrigeration needed.**

**Shelf life:** 5–7 days in sealed container at room temperature (crunch diminishes after day 3–4; best fresh).

**Price:** $3.49 (3 oz cup) | **Food cost:** ~$0.35–$0.50 (chickpeas $0.15, spices $0.05, oil $0.05, container $0.10) | **Food cost %:** ~10–14% | **Gross margin: ~86–90%**

**Prep:** Drain and dry 2 cans chickpeas. Toss with olive oil and spice blend. Spread on parchment sheet pan. Bake 400°F for 25–30 minutes, shaking pan halfway. Cool completely. Portion into cups. One batch (2 cans) yields ~10 servings. Already in Livite's recipe repertoire (roasted chickpeas are on the existing menu).

**Target persona:** The between-meals crunchy-craving customer. GLP-1 users wanting a high-protein (10g), high-fiber (6g) ambient snack they can grab without waiting. Students who want a savory, salty snack that isn't chips. **This is your direct replacement for the packaged plantain chips — house-made, higher-margin, and uniquely Livite.**

Add the 5 refrigerated items when the display case is purchased.

## 6. Revenue maximizer add-ons beyond the current three

Livite already has three strong add-ons (Prebiotic Boost $1.50, Protein Boost $2.00, Double Protein $3.50). The functional ingredient add-on category delivers **85–95% gross margins** — collagen costing $0.15–$0.25 per scoop sells for $2.00. With proper POS prompts and staff training, **30–40% attachment rates** are achievable, increasing average transaction value by 15–25%. At 70 customers/day, a $1.50 average add-on increase generates **$38,000+ in additional annual revenue**.

### New add-ons to launch

**Collagen Boost — $2.00** | Cost: $0.15–$0.25/scoop | Margin: ~88–92%. Add to any smoothie or overnight oats. Collagen peptides dissolve instantly and are flavorless. Tropical Smoothie Cafe's partnership with Vital Proteins confirms mainstream demand. Position as "Skin + Joint Support." Consider using a branded collagen (Vital Proteins) for consumer trust — the name recognition drives conversion.

**Adaptogen Boost (Ashwagandha + Maca) — $1.50** | Cost: $0.15–$0.25/scoop | Margin: ~83–90%. Add to any smoothie. Ashwagandha is the #1 trending adaptogen for stress relief and energy. Pre-mix ashwagandha + maca powder in a labeled shaker for easy dispensing. Position as "Calm Energy" or "Focus Boost."

**Lion's Mane Mushroom Boost — $2.00** | Cost: $0.15–$0.30/scoop | Margin: ~85–90%. Add to any smoothie. Functional mushrooms are experiencing double-digit growth. Position as "Brain Boost." Lion's mane is the most consumer-friendly mushroom (no earthy taste concerns when blended into smoothies).

**Chia & Flax Seed Boost — $1.00** | Cost: $0.05–$0.10/scoop | Margin: ~90–95%. Add to any smoothie, bowl, or overnight oats. Lowest-cost, highest-margin add-on possible. Position as "Fiber + Omega-3 Boost." Pairs with the "fiber is the new protein" trend.

**Side of House Hummus + Pita Chips — $2.99** | Cost: $0.55–$0.70 | Margin: ~77–82%. Available as an add-on to any bowl or wrap order. Hummus batch-prepped in food processor. Pita chips sourced. Replicates CAVA's side dip model ($2.49–$3.79) at a competitive price with house-made quality.

**Extra Avocado — $2.00** | Cost: $0.50–$0.75 | Margin: ~63–75%. Universal add-on across all bowls, wraps, and salads. Avocado is the most-requested premium add-on in fast-casual (Sweetgreen, CAVA, Chipotle all charge $1.50–$3.25). Already sourced for spring menu.

### Updated add-on menu architecture

| Add-On | Price | Margin | Category |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chia & Flax Boost | $1.00 | ~93% | Functional |
| Prebiotic Boost (existing) | $1.50 | ~90%+ | Functional |
| Adaptogen Boost | $1.50 | ~87% | Functional |
| Protein Boost (existing) | $2.00 | ~83% | Functional |
| Collagen Boost | $2.00 | ~90% | Functional |
| Lion's Mane Boost | $2.00 | ~88% | Functional |
| Extra Avocado | $2.00 | ~70% | Food |
| Side Hummus + Chips | $2.99 | ~80% | Food |
| Double Protein (existing) | $3.50 | ~65% | Food |

**Recommended POS prompt:** Train staff to say "Would you like to add a collagen or protein boost for just $2?" on every smoothie order. Add a "Boost Your Bowl" prompt on the digital ordering screen. Target minimum **25% attachment rate** on smoothie orders within 60 days.

## 7. Three candidates for Livite's signature snack

The healthy fast-casual space has a massive signature snack vacuum. **Sweetgreen has no signature snack.** Neither does Pret, Life Alive, Dig, or Just Salad. CAVA's Crazy Feta is the only item approaching cult status, but it's ordered as a bowl add-on, not a standalone purchase. **The first healthy fast-casual brand to create a true "people come in just for this" snack item will own a category.**

### Candidate 1: Livite Tahini Bites — "The Bite"

**What it is:** A 3-pack of tahini-date energy bites with a proprietary Mediterranean twist — Medjool dates, tahini, toasted pistachios, chia seeds, cacao nibs, sea salt, drizzle of honey. Coated half in crushed pistachios (green) and half in cacao powder (dark brown) for visual contrast. Sold in a clear branded container. Offered in rotating seasonal flavors: **Classic (pistachio + cacao)**, **Lemon-Ginger** (lemon zest + ginger + turmeric), **Mint-Chocolate** (mint + cacao + coconut).

**Why it's addictive/craveable:** The tahini + date + salt combination creates a savory-sweet umami effect that is genuinely hard to stop eating. Tahini's nutty richness combined with date's caramel sweetness and sea salt creates "one more bite" compulsion. The pistachio crunch coating adds textural contrast. This is the Mediterranean equivalent of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup — two great flavors that combine into something greater.

**Why people would come in just for this:** At **$4.49 for 3**, it's an impulse-friendly price below the "do I really need this?" threshold. Students can grab one between classes. Office workers can grab one at 3 PM. The seasonal rotation (borrowing from Crumbl's weekly drop model) creates "what's the new flavor?" repeat visits. These can be kept at the register in an ambient basket — no refrigerated case needed.

**Instagram/word-of-mouth potential:** High — the pistachio-green and cacao-brown visual contrast in a clear container photographs well. The "Bite" branding is shareable ("Have you tried the Livite Bites?"). The tahini-date profile is on-trend but not yet owned by any competitor in Boston.

**Price and margin:** $4.49 | Food cost $0.55–$0.70 | **Gross margin: ~84–87%**

**Evaluation scores:**
- Prep simplicity: ★★★★★ — Food processor, roll, coat. 15 minutes per 60 bites. Zero cooking.
- Shelf life: ★★★★★ — 7–14 days in walk-in, 4+ hours ambient. Longest shelf life of any candidate.
- Margin: ★★★★★ — 84–87%. Exceeds 70% target by 14+ points.
- Customer demand: ★★★★☆ — Energy bites are proven sellers (Freshii's Energii Bites, RXBar Protein Energy Bites). Tahini demand up 11.4% in 2024. Mediterranean diet = #1 ranked diet.
- Uniqueness: ★★★★★ — No competitor in Boston sells a tahini-date bite. Sweetgreen, CAVA, Life Alive have nothing comparable.

### Candidate 2: Livite Whipped Feta Dip + Za'atar Pita Chips

**What it is:** A 6 oz cup of house-whipped feta dip (feta, Greek yogurt, lemon juice, garlic, chili flakes, olive oil — blended in Vitamix until cloud-light and creamy) served with a side of house-seasoned za'atar pita chips. Sold as a grab-and-go combo in a 2-compartment container. The dip is garnished with a swirl of olive oil, a sprinkle of sumac, and fresh herbs.

**Why it's addictive/craveable:** CAVA proved this with Crazy Feta — whipped feta is genuinely one of the most addictive dip formats in food (the combo of salt, fat, acid, and umami from aged feta hits every craving receptor). Livite's version adds the lemon-herb brightness and chili kick that makes it impossible to stop dipping. The za'atar pita chips add an aromatic, herbal crunch that elevates basic chips.

**Why people would come in just for this:** This is a **direct competitor to CAVA's Crazy Feta** — but grab-and-go format, $5.99 vs. CAVA's $3.55 side (which requires ordering a meal). Office workers would buy this for their desk. Students would buy it as a shared snack. The "I need that feta dip" pull is proven by CAVA's cult following — Livite just needs to capture the same craving in a grab-and-go format nobody else offers.

**Instagram/word-of-mouth potential:** Very high — the olive oil swirl, herb garnish, and sumac dusting on white whipped feta creates a beautiful visual. "Livite's feta dip" becomes a shorthand recommendation. The dip format has proven retail extension potential (CAVA sells Crazy Feta at Whole Foods).

**Price and margin:** $5.99 | Food cost ~$1.20–$1.50 (feta $0.45, yogurt $0.15, lemon/garlic/oil $0.15, pita chips $0.25, container $0.25) | **Gross margin: ~75–80%**

**Evaluation scores:**
- Prep simplicity: ★★★★☆ — Vitamix: blend feta, yogurt, lemon, garlic, oil. 5 minutes per batch (yields 15 portions). Pita chips need sourcing or seasoning purchased chips with za'atar.
- Shelf life: ★★★☆☆ — 3–5 days refrigerated. Dairy-based = shorter window. **Requires refrigerated case.**
- Margin: ★★★★☆ — 75–80%. Meets 70% target but lower than Bites due to feta cost.
- Customer demand: ★★★★★ — CAVA's Crazy Feta has proven cult demand. Dozens of copycat recipes online. People write "it's all I've been able to think about since I left the restaurant."
- Uniqueness: ★★★★☆ — CAVA has Crazy Feta, but no one sells it grab-and-go. Life Alive, Sweetgreen, Dig have nothing similar.

### Candidate 3: Pistachio-Honey Crunch Cup

**What it is:** A layered cup with thick Greek yogurt base, a generous ribbon of raw honey, and a proprietary pistachio-herb crunch topping (roasted pistachios, fresh herbs, olive oil, salt — from Livite's spring R&D Pistachio-Herb Crunch sauce). Topped with a few pomegranate seeds (seasonal) or fresh berries. Served in a clear 12 oz cup with dome lid showing the green-white-red layers.

**Why it's addictive/craveable:** The cold, thick Greek yogurt against the crunchy, salty, herbal pistachio topping and sweet honey creates a three-texture, three-flavor experience in every bite. Pistachio is the breakout ingredient of 2025–2026 (Tatte's pistachio lattes, the pistachio craze across bakeries). The herb element makes this savory-sweet-herbal in a way that yogurt parfaits at Starbucks or Tatte simply are not.

**Why people would come in just for this:** At **$6.99**, it's priced as a premium snack that feels like a treat. The pistachio crunch is proprietary — Livite's house-made recipe that no one else has. It's a "better Tatte yogurt bowl" ($7.25 at Tatte) in grab-and-go format with a unique herbal twist. The dome lid showing pistachio-green layers against white yogurt is beautiful through a display case.

**Instagram/word-of-mouth potential:** High — the green pistachio crunch on white yogurt with red berries is visually striking. The dome lid creates a "crown" effect. Mediterranean yogurt cups are highly shareable.

**Price and margin:** $6.99 | Food cost ~$1.10–$1.40 | **Gross margin: ~80–84%**

**Evaluation scores:**
- Prep simplicity: ★★★★☆ — Yogurt portioned from bulk. Pistachio crunch batch-prepped weekly (oven). Assembly: 30 seconds per cup.
- Shelf life: ★★★☆☆ — 2–3 days (berries limit). **Requires refrigerated case.** Keep granola separate in nested cup.
- Margin: ★★★★★ — 80–84%. Exceeds 70% target.
- Customer demand: ★★★★☆ — Pistachio is the #1 trending nut ingredient. Yogurt parfaits are Pret's top snack category. Tatte sells yogurt bowls at $7.25 with high demand.
- Uniqueness: ★★★★★ — No competitor in Boston has a herb-pistachio yogurt cup. Tatte's version uses standard granola. Sweetgreen has nothing.

### Signature snack recommendation

**Lead with the Tahini Bites ("The Bite").** It scores highest across all five criteria — best margins (84–87%), longest shelf life (ambient-stable), simplest prep (no cooking, food processor only), strong uniqueness, and zero equipment requirement. Launch it immediately as a countertop item. Simultaneously develop the Whipped Feta Dip as the signature refrigerated item and the Pistachio-Honey Crunch Cup as the premium display case anchor — both launch when the refrigerated case arrives.

## 8. Packaging and display solutions: two paths forward

### Path A: No refrigerated case (launch immediately)

Stock a **countertop tiered display** near the register with ambient-stable items only: Tahini-Date Energy Bites, Honey-Sumac Almond Clusters, Roasted Chickpea Crunch Cups, packaged plantain chips, and house-baked cookies. A simple 3-tier acrylic or wire basket display ($30–$80 from WebstaurantStore) is sufficient. This creates immediate visual merchandising without capital investment.

Ambient-safe items for countertop display include any baked good, energy bites (date-based, low moisture), roasted chickpeas, nut mixes, trail mix, whole fruit, and packaged chips. These items have low water activity (aw <0.85) which inhibits pathogen growth, making them FDA-compliant for extended room-temperature display.

### Path B: Purchase a refrigerated case (recommended)

For Livite's footprint and needs, the best options in two categories:

**Countertop refrigerated case (if counter space is available):** The **Marchia MDC120-ST** (27" wide, 4.25 cu ft, ~$800–$1,200) is the best value — straight glass front, digital temp control, LED lighting, auto-defrost, sliding rear doors for easy restocking. Holds **20–30 grab-and-go items** across 2 adjustable shelves. Alternative: **Avantco BCC-35-HC** (34.5" wide, ~$1,000–$1,400) for slightly more capacity.

**Floor-standing open-air grab-and-go cooler (if floor space is available):** The **Marchia MDS390** (36" wide, ~$2,500–$2,630) is an open-front self-service unit with 3 adjustable shelves, LED lighting, and lockable casters. Customers grab items directly — no staff interaction needed. This is the format used by Pret A Manger, Starbucks, and Whole Foods for their grab-and-go sections. Alternative premium option: **Turbo Air TOM-36EB-N** (36" wide, ~$3,500–$4,500) with energy-saving night curtain and 5-year compressor warranty.

**Investment recommendation:** Start with the **Marchia MDC120-ST countertop unit at ~$1,000**. At projected grab-and-go revenue of $150–$250/day (25–40 items at $4–$7 average), with 75%+ gross margins, the case pays for itself in **5–7 days of sales**. If volume exceeds the countertop capacity within 3 months, upgrade to the floor-standing unit.

### Packaging cost summary per unit (wholesale from WebstaurantStore)

| Container | Size | Cost/Unit | Best For |
|---|---|---|---|
| Clear PET clamshell | 4–8 oz | $0.15–$0.30 | Energy bites, chickpea cups |
| PP deli container + lid | 12 oz | $0.10–$0.18 | Chia pudding, yogurt cups |
| PP deli container + lid | 16 oz | $0.15–$0.22 | Overnight oats, grain cups |
| PET dome lid | Fits 12–16 oz | $0.05–$0.10 | Parfaits (shows toppings) |
| 2 oz portion cup | Souffle cup | $0.02–$0.04 | Dip, dressing, granola insert |
| 3-compartment clamshell | 16 oz | $0.30–$0.60 | Snack boxes, catering boxes |
| Kraft bag with window | Small | $0.05–$0.15 | Nut clusters, trail mix, chickpeas |
| Branded sticker labels | 2"x3" | $0.03–$0.08 | All items |

**Total packaging investment to launch full program:** ~$200–$400 for initial stock of all containers (buying cases of 200–500 units each).

## 9. Pricing benchmarks confirm Livite's sweet spot

The Boston/Brookline healthy grab-and-go market prices across a clear spectrum. Tatte (the premium anchor) charges $7.25–$9.75 for yogurt and grain items. Cocobeet charges $6–$8 for yogurt pots. Life Alive's chia pudding runs $6–$7. Sweetgreen's sides sit at $2.95–$5.25. CAVA's snacks are $2.90–$3.55. Pret A Manger (NYC comparison) prices pots at $4.50–$7.50.

**Livite's pricing architecture should follow a three-tier structure:**

**Tier 1 — Impulse ($3.49–$4.49):** Roasted Chickpea Cups ($3.49), Honey-Sumac Almond Clusters ($3.99), Tahini-Date Energy Bites ($4.49). These sit at or near the register, require no refrigeration, and are priced for zero decision friction. A student should be able to grab one without hesitation.

**Tier 2 — Substantial snack ($5.99–$6.99):** Mediterranean Hummus & Veggie Cup ($5.99), Chocolate-Tahini Chia Pudding ($5.99), Turmeric-Ginger Overnight Oats ($6.49), Pistachio-Crunch Yogurt Cup ($6.99). These are the Pret Pots equivalent — filling enough to replace a small meal, beautiful through the display case, and priced in the Brookline sweet spot.

**Tier 3 — Mini-meal ($7.99):** Spring Farro Power Cup ($7.99). This anchors the top of the grab-and-go range, positioned as an alternative to a full bowl for customers who want something lighter or cheaper.

For catering snack add-ons, the per-person pricing ($4.99–$8.99) undercuts the premium end of CAVA's catering ($6.70/person for assorted dips & chips) while offering significantly more variety, protein, and health positioning. The **$6.49–$6.99/person** range is the competitive sweet spot based on EZCater industry data showing $5–$8/person as the standard afternoon snack add-on range.

### How Livite stacks up against local competitors

| Item Type | Tatte | Life Alive | Cocobeet | Livite (Proposed) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Yogurt/parfait cup | $7.25–$9.75 | N/A | $6–$8 | **$6.99** |
| Overnight oats | $7–$8 | N/A | N/A | **$6.49** |
| Chia pudding | N/A | $6–$7 | N/A | **$5.99** |
| Energy bites | N/A | $4.75 (Energii Bites) | N/A | **$4.49** |
| Hummus dip cup | N/A | ~$5 | N/A | **$5.99** |
| Grain salad cup | $9–$10 | N/A | N/A | **$7.99** |
| Nut/snack bag | N/A | N/A | N/A | **$3.49–$3.99** |

Livite prices 10–15% below Tatte on comparable items (yogurt, grains) while offering items nobody else has (energy bites, chia pudding, hummus cups, nut clusters, chickpea cups). This is the **value + variety + health** triple advantage.

## Putting it all together: the launch roadmap

**Week 1–2 (Immediate, no equipment needed):** Launch the 3 ambient items at the register — Tahini-Date Energy Bites ($4.49), Honey-Sumac Almond Clusters ($3.99), Roasted Chickpea Crunch Cups ($3.49). Add them to the EZCater/Forkable listing as catering add-ons. Add Collagen Boost ($2), Adaptogen Boost ($1.50), and Chia & Flax Boost ($1) to the smoothie bar. Total investment: ~$200 in packaging + ~$150 in ingredients = **$350 to launch**.

**Week 3–4 (After case arrives):** Purchase the Marchia MDC120-ST countertop refrigerated case (~$1,000). Launch all 5 refrigerated items: Pistachio-Crunch Yogurt Cup, Turmeric-Ginger Overnight Oats, Mediterranean Hummus & Veggie Cup, Spring Farro Power Cup, Chocolate-Tahini Chia Pudding. Stock the case each morning with 4–6 of each item.

**Week 5–6:** Launch the 5 catering snack add-ons across Forkable, EZCater, Cater2me, and direct accounts. List the "Livite Afternoon Snack Pack" at $6.99/person (choose 2 items). Train the catering sales process: every lunch order gets asked "Would you like to add afternoon snacks for the team?"

**Week 7–8:** Evaluate sales data. Double down on winners, cut underperformers. Introduce rotating seasonal energy bite flavors (Lemon-Ginger for late spring, Mint-Chocolate for summer). Begin testing the Whipped Feta Dip as the second signature item.

**Revenue projection at steady state:** 30–40 grab-and-go items sold per day at $5.50 average = **$165–$220/day = $5,000–$6,600/month** in new revenue at 75%+ margins. Add catering snack add-ons at ~$300–$500/week = **$1,200–$2,000/month** incremental. Add functional boost add-ons at 25% attachment on 70 daily orders x $1.75 average = **$900–$1,000/month**. **Total incremental revenue: $7,100–$9,600/month** from the snack program — with margins substantially higher than the core menu.

The investment is minimal. The margin is exceptional. The competitive gap is wide open. Every day without a grab-and-go program is revenue left sitting on the counter.
